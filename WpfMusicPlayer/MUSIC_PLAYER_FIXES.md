# Music Player Fixes Applied

## Problems Fixed:

### 1. **Shuffle Feature Not Working**

**Problem:** Next/Previous buttons ignored shuffle mode and just moved linearly through the displayed list.

**Solution:**

- Modified `NextButton_Click` and `PreviousButton_Click` to use `PlayerService.PlayNext()` and `PlayerService.PlayPrevious()`
- These methods respect the current `PlayMode` (Normal, Shuffle, RepeatOne, RepeatAll)
- UI selection now follows the actual playing song instead of driving it

### 2. **Repeat All Not Working at End of Catalog**

**Problem:** When reaching the end of songs, the player didn't loop back to the beginning in RepeatAll mode.

**Solution:**

- Fixed `GetNextIndex()` method to properly handle RepeatAll mode: `(CurrentIndex + 1) % Queue.Count`
- Enhanced `OnPlaybackStopped` to handle RepeatAll mode explicitly
- Added logging for debugging the auto-advance behavior

### 3. **Auto-play to Next Song Not Working**

**Problem:** When a song ended naturally, the next song didn't start automatically.

**Solution:**

- Improved `OnPlaybackStopped` event handler to properly detect natural song endings
- Added logic to auto-advance based on play mode
- Fixed infinite loop prevention for single-song scenarios
- Added proper handling for RepeatOne mode (restart same song)

### 4. **UI and Logic Disconnected**

**Problem:** UI drove playback instead of reflecting the player state.

**Solution:**

- Changed `SongsListView_MouseDoubleClick` to use `PlaySongFromCollection()` instead of `PlaySongDirectly()`
- This sets the entire displayed collection as the queue, enabling proper navigation
- Added `UpdateUISelection()` method to sync UI with actual player state
- Modified `OnCurrentSongChanged` to update UI selection automatically

### 5. **Play Mode Button Clarity**

**Problem:** Shuffle button didn't clearly show what mode was active.

**Solution:**

- Updated `PlayModeToStringConverter` to show descriptive text:
  - "üîÄ Normal"
  - "üîÅ Repeat All"
  - "üîÇ Repeat One"
  - "üîÄ Shuffle"

### 6. **Queue Management Issues**

**Problem:** Next/Previous buttons didn't work when no queue was set.

**Solution:**

- Added safety checks to populate queue with DisplayedSongs if empty
- Ensures navigation always works regardless of how the user interacted with the player

## How Music Player Logic Now Works:

1. **Central Queue**: All playback is driven by the PlayerService queue
2. **Mode Respect**: All navigation (next/prev/auto) honors the current PlayMode
3. **Natural Flow**: Songs end ‚Üí auto-advance based on mode ‚Üí UI reflects change
4. **Consistent State**: UI shows what's playing, doesn't dictate what plays

## Testing Scenarios:

1. **Normal Mode**: Play through songs sequentially, stop at end
2. **Repeat All**: Loop back to beginning when reaching end of queue
3. **Repeat One**: Restart same song when it ends
4. **Shuffle**: Play songs in random order, regenerate shuffle order when completed
5. **Mixed Navigation**: Use next/previous buttons while in any mode
6. **Double-click Song**: Sets queue and plays from that point with proper navigation

## Architecture Improvement:

The player now follows proper music player patterns:

- **Event-driven**: Song changes trigger UI updates
- **State-managed**: PlayerService maintains authoritative state
- **Mode-aware**: All operations respect current play mode
- **Queue-centric**: Queue drives all playback decisions

Your music player should now work like a proper music application! üéµ
