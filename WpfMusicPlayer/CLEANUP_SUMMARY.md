# Music Player Services Cleanup

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up the duplicated and overlapping services in the WPF Music Player application by consolidating them into a single, unified service.

## Changes Made

### Deleted Files

- `Services/AudioService.cs` - Basic audio playback functionality
- `Services/MusicLibraryService.cs` - Music library management and playlist handling
- `Services/PlayerService.cs` - Player controls and queue management
- `Services/SongManager.cs` - Song navigation logic

### Created Files

- `Services/MusicService.cs` - Unified service containing ALL functionality from the deleted services

### Updated Files

- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Updated to use the new `MusicService` instead of separate services
- `PlaylistDetailsWindow.xaml.cs` - Updated constructor and service references

## Key Features of the New MusicService

### Audio Control

- Audio file loading and playback using NAudio
- Play, pause, stop, seek functionality
- Volume control
- Position tracking with timer updates

### Music Library Management

- Folder scanning for supported audio formats (.mp3, .wav, .flac, .aac, .ogg, .m4a, .wma)
- Song metadata extraction using TagLib#
- Search functionality across songs, artists, albums, and genres
- Album art extraction

### Playlist Management

- Create, delete, and update playlists
- Add/remove songs from playlists
- Persistent storage using JSON files in AppData
- Cover image support for playlists

### Queue and Playback Management

- Queue management with add/remove capabilities
- Multiple play modes: Normal, Repeat All, Repeat One, Shuffle
- Smart shuffle algorithm with Fisher-Yates shuffle
- Proper song navigation (next/previous) respecting play modes
- Auto-advance to next song on completion

### Event System

- Property change notifications for UI binding
- Events for song changes, playback state changes, position updates
- Queue change notifications
- Scan progress updates

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Eliminated Duplication** - No more multiple iterations of the same functions
2. **Simplified Architecture** - Single service to manage instead of 4 separate ones
3. **Better Maintainability** - All related functionality in one place
4. **Reduced Coupling** - UI components only need to reference one service
5. **Consistent State Management** - No more state synchronization issues between services
6. **Cleaner Dependencies** - Constructor injection simplified

## Technical Notes

- Fixed ambiguous references between `WpfMusicPlayer.Models.PlaybackState` and `NAudio.Wave.PlaybackState`
- Fixed ambiguous references between `TagLib.File` and `System.IO.File`
- Maintained all existing functionality while removing redundancy
- Preserved all events and property bindings for UI compatibility

The application is now much cleaner, more maintainable, and should work without the previous "tweaked out" behavior caused by duplicate services.
