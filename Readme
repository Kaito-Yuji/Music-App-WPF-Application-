# 🎵 Music App WPF Application  

## 📖 Introduction  

This project is a **Music Player Application** built with **C# WPF**.  

The purpose of this application is not only to play songs, but also to provide intelligent features powered by **AI**.  

The app was created to help users interact with their music in new ways, such as splitting vocals from instrumentals and detecting the emotional mood of a song.  

It aims to become more than just a normal player – it is designed as a companion for music lovers, karaoke fans, and learners who want to explore audio at a deeper level.

## ✨ Features  

### 🎤 Audio Splitter (AI) – Separate Vocals and Instrumentals  

- The app allows the user to load a music file (such as `.mp3` or `.wav`).  

- By using AI models, the application can **separate the vocals** and **the instrumental track** into two different files.  

- This feature is useful in real situations:  
  - Create a karaoke version of a song.  
  - Practice singing with only the background instrumental.  
  - Study the singer’s voice in isolation.

### 🧠 Mood Detection (AI) – Identify Song Emotions  

- The app analyzes the audio with AI to understand the **mood or emotion** of the song.  

- It can detect categories such as:  
  - Happy and energetic.  
  - Sad and emotional.  
  - Calm, relaxing, or “chill”.  

- Benefits of this feature:  
  - Helps users discover music based on their current feelings.  
  - Supports automatic playlist generation by mood.  
  - Makes the listening experience more personal and enjoyable.

  - Play, Pause, and Stop songs.  
  - Manage playlists.  
  - Provide a clean WPF interface for easy navigation.
